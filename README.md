# logging-bot
Discord bot to send output from a bash script to Discord channels

## usage
```shell
cargo run -- path_to_script script.sh
```
use the `!log` command in a Discord channel to start logging

#todo:
- clean up code
- make bot compatible with more filetypes (not just bash)
- reduce input arguments to a single path
